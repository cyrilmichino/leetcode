# Leetcode 150
In this repository, I'll be solving **Leetcode 150 top interview questions**. [Click this link to find the questions on Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-interview-150/).

If you are totally green in data structures and algorithms, you can check out [this course by Zindua School](https://zinduaschool.com/courses/data-structures-algorithms/?ref=9). It runs twice a year and I am one of instructors teaching Algorithm Foundations and Divide & Conquer algorithms. You can also learn more about me, what I do, and what what I build [on my website](https://cyril.michino.co.ke).

As you build, you can **track the progress of completed solutions here**. I'll be solving at least one daily for the next 150 business days:
